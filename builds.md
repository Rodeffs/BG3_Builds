# List of some interesting builds from best to worst (subjective)

## Important to consider

* Only EVEN ability values matter. For instance, your STR modifier is 0 both at 10 STR and at 11 STR, but it's 1 at 12 STR
* On Honour Mode extra attacks from Pact of the Blade and from classes DO NOT stack unlike on lower difficulties
* On Honour Mode extra actions from Haste, Potion of Speed and others DO NOT give you extra attacks. The only exception is Action Surge 
* Scrolls, spell recasts (like Call Lightning) and some effects (like Mortal Reminder) use Spellcasting Modifier of the LAST new class you levelled. E.g. if you take a level in Fighter after only leveling Warlock, then Mortal Reminder will use INT instead of CHR
* You DO NOT get Armour Proficiencies while multiclassing into a class. You only get them from your FIRST class, your race and subclasses (including those you multiclass to). E.g. multiclassing into Fighter won't give you Heavy Armour Proficiency but multiclassing into Tempest Cleric will
* You use Saving Throw Proficiencies only from your FIRST class. This is especially important for casters, since the Saving Throw to maintain Concentration uses CON, so it's valuable to have Proficiency in it
* Advantages and Disadvantages DO NOT stack. If both are applied, then they cancel each other out. So if you have multiple sources of Disadvantages and one source of Advantage, then all will be cancelled. That works the other way around as well
* When thrown, weapons with the Thrown property use their weapon damage, whereas everything else uses its weight as damage
* Make one of your camp members into a Cleric, using them cast Aid on everyone then leave them at camp. You can also do this with spells like Warding Bond, Freedom of Movement, Mage Armour, Longstrider, etc
* If you go inside Darkness or Fog Cloud FIRST and then hide, enemies will just skip their turns if there aren't any other valid targets. Combined with hide as a Bonus Action this creates very OP combo, where you can freely attack or cast spells with regular Action and then spend a Bonus Action hiding. Note that this DOES NOT work against enemies who can see through Darkness or can't be blinded
* The bits about Darkness and Fog Cloud are the reasons why I ranked builds with those spells higher and also are the reasons to get at least two levels of Rogue in order to be able to hide inside them with a Bonus Action
* Some perma buffs useful for any build:
    * Act 1: Get Auntie Ethel to low HP and then spare her to get +1 to any Ability (one-time use). The builds listed here assume that you took it to increase your highest ability. If you didn't, then just take any ability increasing feat to get to an even value (like Athlete for +1 to STR or DEX)
    * Act 2: In the Moonrise Towers speak to Araj Oblodra with Astarion in party and make him drink her blood to get Potion of Everlasting Vigour for +2 STR (one-time use)
    * Act 3: At the Mirror of Loss in the House of Grief you may get +1 CHR. Also, if you pass DC 25 Religion check, then you may get +2 to any Ability (once per character)
