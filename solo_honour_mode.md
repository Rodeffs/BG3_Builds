## Playthrough

### General tips

* Cast Fog Cloud then hide in it with Bonus Action on the first turn
* On the following turns, step out of Fog Cloud, shoot enemies, then hide back in with Bonus Action
    * If you have Eversight Ring, shoot straight out of Fog Cloud
    * If you have Bhaalist Armour and Crossbow Expert, cast Fog Cloud on top of enemies and shoot them point-blank
* Keep track of the turn number in combat log. Fog Cloud lasts exactly for 10 turns including the turn you cast it on. So for instance if you cast it on turn 1, then you will need to recast it on turn 10, after that recast on turn 19, then 28 and so on. Rule of thumb: just add 9 to the turn number when you previously casted the Fog Cloud
* ALWAYS have available spell slots before combat! Go to sleep as soon as you've run out of spell slots
* Enemies with Devil's Sight or anything that lets them see through magical darkness completely ruin this tactic. Neither Fog Cloud nor Darkness works against them. Avoid encounters with them
* Keep in mind that enemies with Counterspell will prevent you from casting Fog Cloud. You will need to bait out the Counterspell first with a cantrip
* If shit goes bad, drink an invisibility potion, cast Umbral Shroud or do anything else to turn yourself invisible and flee combat! Speed potion are also good for this to Disengage and Dash away
* As a last resort, force reboot your PC to prevent save override. Do this before you see the death message, otherwise it's a fail

### Act 1

Recommended route:
1. Farm XP until level 3
2. Deal with Kagha by reading her notes in a chest behind the bookshelf and then getting evidence from the stump at the swamp
3. Clear the avanpost where Withers sleeps
4. Farm XP until level 4
5. Deal with Auntie Ethel and get +1 to DEX by sparing her
6. Continue progression as usual

You should skip the fight with Grym at the Grymforge since it may go bad and cause you the run. If you want to fight regardless, then you should prepare thoroughly. Drink Elixir of Peerless focus, equip Boots of Striding and cast Slow on Grym via a scroll. This should keep him under the hammer and should prevent you from being prone and from ending your concentration. Misty Step is also essential in order to kite Grym. Also remember, levers can be activated by shooting at them

Only kill the harpies at the Secluded Cove after reaching level 5. This is because you need to kill them quickly before they get to sing and possibly charm you

Against beholders, be sure to stay at least 20 meters from them to not get stunned by their spin attack

Also, drink an Elixir of Vigilance against the beholder in the Underdark to not get surprised and stunned

Against Bullette in the Underdark, Lava Elemental at the Grymforge and other enemies with HP regen, use Arrows of Illmater

For the undead enemies at the Mountain Pass: pick up the enemy corpses to prevent Death Shepherds from reanimating them

Be careful while getting the Blood of Lathander, the traps might push you into the chasm

The same may happen in the fight with the duergar on the rafts in Underdark if you don't hide in Fog Cloud

Collect all the Smokepowder Barrels and Smokepowder Bombs you can. They can be found at Zhentarim Hideout, Goblin Camp and etc. This will be useful later

You should also get Runepowder Barrel from Philomeen at the Grymforge by sneaking past her and stealing it. You may also rob her Runepowder Vial

Notable enemies with Counterspell:
* Gekh Coal in the Underdark
* Ghustil Stornugoss at the Creshe
* Varsh Ko'kuu at the Creshe

### Act 2

You should skip the encounter with Shadow-Cursed Shambling Mound as it's immune to piercing

With Kar'niss you must first kill him and only then the other fanatics, otherwise he will kill you with Fanatic Retaliation

With Malus you must first kill the nurses before dealing with him, otherwise he will kill you with Wail of Loss. If he resurrects a nurse, kill her and only then damage Malus

With Thisobald you must spam elemental spells or elemental arrows at him first in order to make him vulnerable to piercing damage

Do not go to Isobel until you've bought 60~80 Smokepowder Bombs (for both Myrkul and the Netherbrain) from Quartermaster Talli at the Last Light Inn. Abuse Partial Long Rests to constantly refresh her stock

Do not fight Yurgir as he can see through Fog Cloud and Darkness. Either convince him to kill himself or free him from his contract by killing all the mice

Do not fight Ch'r'ai Tska'an. She is located on the bridge on the way to Baldur's Gate. She has Devil Sight and can easily kill you. Better skip her completely and just use invisibility potion to pass her after you've slain Myrkul

Otherwise play as usual

Notable enemies with Counterspell:
* Z'rell at the Moonrise Towers

### Myrkul Fight

You will need at least:
* 1 Arrow of Fire or Alchemist's Fire
* 1 Potion of Invisibility
* 1 Potion of Speed
* 1 Scroll of Misty Step
* 30~40 Smokepowder Bombs

Gather all of those items before going to the Mind Flayer Colony

If you have Smokepowder Barrels or Runepowder Barrel, then you should also drink an Elixir of Hill Giant Strength and carry as many as possible with you

Then do as follows:
1. Before getting close to Ketheric, drink a Potion of Invisibility and get close to Nightsong
2. Wait until invisibility wears off
3. After the dialogue, throw a Potion of Speed at your feet, Help the Nightsong and walk on top of the platform where Ketheric stands
3. If you fight Ketheric first:
    * Cast Fog Cloud and hide in it with Bonus Action
    * On the following turns kill the illithid first and only then Ketheric. Don't forget to hide with Bonus Action
4. When the Apostle of Myrkul spawns:
    * Place all your bombs near it
    * Misty Step away
    * Shoot them either with an Arrow of Fire or throw an Alchemist's Fire at them
    
### Act 3

You should skip Gortash fight by allying with him since The Closed Fist of Bane will surely break your Fog Cloud concentration

You should also skip Viconia DeVir fight as she and her sharrans can see through both Fog Cloud and Darkness. If you want to get to the Mirror of Loss, you should just drink a Potion of Invisibility, cast Knock on the door leading to it and get inside with a Potion of Invisibility again. To get out just use fast travel

You must definitely skip the fight with Raphael as he can see through Fog Cloud and Darkness. Do not go to hell in general for that matter

If you want to fight Cazador, then be sure to have Daylight spell with you. Before approaching him, drink a speed potion, then cast Daylight with the first action and Fog Cloud with the second. You must kill one of his spawn first (apart from Astarion) otherwise he will become almost unkillable

You should also get Runepowder Bomb from Wulbern and keep it for the Finale

Otherwise you may progress as per usual

### Orin Fight

You will need at least:
* Level 12
* Surgeon's Subjugation Amulet
* Bhaalist Armour
* Crossbow Expert feat
* Luck of the Far Realms or Killer's Sweetheart active

The combat:
1. Cast Fog Cloud directly on her and hide there with her
2. On the next turn shoot her point-blank and make this hit a critical with either Luck of the Far Realms or Killer's Sweetheart. Now she will be paralysed due to Surgeon's Subjugation Amulet and you may quickly finish her

This method also works with Sarevok if you want to fight him

### The Finale

You will need at least:
* 6 Potions of Invisibility
* 1 Potion of Speed
* 1 Potion of Flight
* 1 Scroll of Dimension Door
* 1 Scroll of Misty Step
* 1 Scroll of Invulnerability Globe
* 1 Arrow of Darkness
* 1 Arrow of Fire or 1 Alchemist's Fire
* 30~40 Smokepowder Bombs

If you have Smokepowder Barrels, Runepowder Barrel or Runepowder Bomb, then you should also grab 2 Elixirs of Hill Giant Strength in order to carry them with you to the Netherbrain

Then do as follows:
1. Sneak through to the Morphic Pool without triggering unnecessary combat
2. Get The Emperor or Orpheus as an illithid on your party (will be further referred to as the Illithid)
3. Sneak through to the building with allies without triggering the fight with the gith
4. Get to the courtyard
5. Throw a Potion of Invisibility at the Illithid and drink one yourself
6. Run through the enemies to the High Hall
7. There drink a Potion of Flight, Dash and fly to the Netherbrain stem and climb it
8. On the first turn of combat:
    * Drink a Potion of Speed
    * Teleport yourself and the Illithid as close to the brain as possible with Dimension Door
    * Throw a Potion of Invisibility at the Illithid and at yourself
    * Walk even closer to the brain away from the position you were initially standing
9. On the second turn:
    * Bait the enemy illithids to cast Counterspell with a cantrip or any spell
    * Cast Karsus' Compulsion
    * Throw a Potion of Invisibility at the Illithid
    * Shoot an Arrow of Darkness under the Illithid but not directly at it
    * Drink a Potion of Invisibility yourself
    * Walk away from the potion you were initially standing
10. On the third turn:
    * Get inside the portal with the Illithid
    * Misty Step as close to the Netherbrain as possible
    * Place all your bombs near it
    * Cast Globe of Invulnerability such as it covers you but not the bombs or the brain
    * Shoot the bombs with an Arrow of Fire or throw an Alchemist's Fire at them
    * If somehow by some miracle the brain survives, then wait until Lethargy wears off and finish off the brain
