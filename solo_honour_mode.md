## Playthrough

### General tips

* Cast Fog Cloud then hide in it with Bonus Action on the first turn
* On the following turns, step out of Fog Cloud, shoot enemies, then hide back in with Bonus Action
    * If you have Eversight Ring, shoot straight out of Fog Cloud
    * If you have Bhaalist Armour and Crossbow Expert, cast Fog Cloud on top of enemies and shoot them point-blank
* Keep track of the turn number in combat log. Fog Cloud lasts exactly for 10 turns including the turn you cast it on. So for instance if you cast it on turn 1, then you will need to recast it on turn 10, after that recast on turn 19, then 28 and so on. Rule of thumb: just add 9 to the turn number when you previously casted the Fog Cloud
* ALWAYS have available spell slots before combat! Go to sleep as soon as you've run out of spell slots
* If shit goes bad, drink an invisibility potion, cast Umbral Shroud or do anything else to turn yourself invisible and flee combat! Speed potion are also good for this to Disengage and Rush away
* As a last resort, force reboot your PC to prevent save override

### Act 1

1. Farm XP until level 3
2. Deal with Kagha by reading her notes in a chest behind the bookshelf and then getting evidence from the stump at the swamp
3. Clear the avanpost where Withers sleeps
4. Farm XP until level 4
5. Deal with Auntie Ethel and get +1 to DEX by sparing her
6. Continue progression as usual, however you should skip these encounters:
    * Harpies at the north of the Grove, because they can stunlock you
    * Beholder in the Underdark and the one in the bottle, because they will stunlock you
    * Bulette in the Underdark, because you won't do any damage to it
    * Grym at the Grymforge, unless you can position it under the hammer
    * Lava elemental at the Grymforge, because it outheals you
7. Note for the undead enemies at the Mountain Pass: pick up the enemy corpses to prevent Death Shepherds from reanimating them
